<HEAD>Â§ 21.4 ETOPS reporting requirements.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Early ETOPS: reporting, tracking, and resolving problems.</I> The holder of a type certificate for an airplane-engine combination approved using the Early ETOPS method specified in part 25, Appendix K, of this chapter must use a system for reporting, tracking, and resolving each problem resulting in one of the occurrences specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.</P>
<P>(1) The system must identify how the type certificate holder will promptly identify problems, report them to the responsible FAA aircraft certification office, and propose a solution to the FAA to resolve each problem. A proposed solution must consist of -</P>
<P>(i) A change in the airplane or engine type design;</P>
<P>(ii) A change in a manufacturing process;</P>
<P>(iii) A change in an operating or maintenance procedure; or</P>
<P>(iv) Any other solution acceptable to the FAA.</P>
<P>(2) For an airplane with more than two engines, the system must be in place for the first 250,000 world fleet engine-hours for the approved airplane-engine combination.</P>
<P>(3) For two-engine airplanes, the system must be in place for the first 250,000 world fleet engine-hours for the approved airplane-engine combination and after that until -</P>
<P>(i) The world fleet 12-month rolling average IFSD rate is at or below the rate required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and</P>
<P>(ii) The FAA determines that the rate is stable.</P>
<P>(4) For an airplane-engine combination that is a derivative of an airplane-engine combination previously approved for ETOPS, the system need only address those problems specified in the following table, provided the type certificate holder obtains prior authorization from the FAA:</P>
<DIV width="100%"><DIV class="gpotbl_div"><TABLE border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1" class="gpotbl_table" frame="void" width="100%"><TR><TH class="gpotbl_colhed" scope="col">If the change does not require a new airplane type certificate and . . .

<P>(5) The type certificate holder must identify the sources and content of data that it will use for its system. The data must be adequate to evaluate the specific cause of any in-service problem reportable under this section or Â§ 21.3(c) that could affect the safety of ETOPS.</P>
<P>(6) In implementing this system, the type certificate holder must report the following occurrences:</P>
<P>(i) IFSDs, except planned IFSDs performed for flight training.</P>
<P>(ii) For two-engine airplanes, IFSD rates.</P>
<P>(iii) Inability to control an engine or obtain desired thrust or power.</P>
<P>(iv) Precautionary thrust or power reductions.</P>
<P>(v) Degraded ability to start an engine in flight.</P>
<P>(vi) Inadvertent fuel loss or unavailability, or uncorrectable fuel imbalance in flight.</P>
<P>(vii) Turn backs or diversions for failures, malfunctions, or defects associated with an ETOPS group 1 significant system.</P>
<P>(viii) Loss of any power source for an ETOPS group 1 significant system, including any power source designed to provide backup power for that system.</P>
<P>(ix) Any event that would jeopardize the safe flight and landing of the airplane on an ETOPS flight.</P>
<P>(x) Any unscheduled engine removal for a condition that could result in one of the reportable occurrences listed in this paragraph.</P>
<P>(b) <I>Reliability of two-engine airplanes</I> - (1) <I>Reporting of two-engine airplane in-service reliability.</I> The holder of a type certificate for an airplane approved for ETOPS and the holder of a type certificate for an engine installed on an airplane approved for ETOPS must report monthly to their respective FAA type certificate holding office on the reliability of the world fleet of those airplanes and engines. The report provided by both the airplane and engine type certificate holders must address each airplane-engine combination approved for ETOPS. The FAA may approve quarterly reporting if the airplane-engine combination demonstrates an IFSD rate at or below those specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for a period acceptable to the FAA. This reporting may be combined with the reporting required by Â§ 21.3. The responsible type certificate holder must investigate any cause of an IFSD resulting from an occurrence attributable to the design of its product and report the results of that investigation to its FAA office responsible for administering its type certificate. Reporting must include:</P>
<P>(i) Engine IFSDs, except planned IFSDs performed for flight training.</P>
<P>(ii) The world fleet 12-month rolling average IFSD rates for all causes, except planned IFSDs performed for flight training.</P>
<P>(iii) ETOPS fleet utilization, including a list of operators, their ETOPS diversion time authority, flight hours, and cycles.</P>
<P>(2) <I>World fleet IFSD rate for two-engine airplanes.</I> The holder of a type certificate for an airplane approved for ETOPS and the holder of a type certificate for an engine installed on an airplane approved for ETOPS must issue service information to the operators of those airplanes and engines, as appropriate, to maintain the world fleet 12-month rolling average IFSD rate at or below the following levels:</P>
<P>(i) A rate of 0.05 per 1,000 world-fleet engine-hours for an airplane-engine combination approved for up to and including 120-minute ETOPS. When all ETOPS operators have complied with the corrective actions required in the configuration, maintenance and procedures (CMP) document as a condition for ETOPS approval, the rate to be maintained is at or below 0.02 per 1,000 world-fleet engine-hours.</P>
<P>(ii) A rate of 0.02 per 1,000 world-fleet engine-hours for an airplane-engine combination approved for up to and including 180-minute ETOPS, including airplane-engine combinations approved for 207-minute ETOPS in the North Pacific operating area under appendix P, section I, paragraph (h), of part 121 of this chapter.</P>
<P>(iii) A rate of 0.01 per 1,000 world-fleet engine-hours for an airplane-engine combination approved for ETOPS beyond 180 minutes, excluding airplane-engine combinations approved for 207-minute ETOPS in the North Pacific operating area under appendix P, section I, paragraph (h), of part 121 of this chapter.</P>

<HEAD>Â§ 21.93 Classification of changes in type design.</HEAD>
<P>(a) In addition to changes in type design specified in paragraph (b) of this section, changes in type design are classified as minor and major. A âminor changeâ is one that has no appreciable effect on the weight, balance, structural strength, reliability, operational characteristics, or other characteristics affecting the airworthiness of the product. All other changes are âmajor changesâ (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section).</P>
<P>(b) For the purpose of complying with Part 36 of this chapter, and except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section, any voluntary change in the type design of an aircraft that may increase the noise levels of that aircraft is an âacoustical changeâ (in addition to being a minor or major change as classified in paragraph (a) of this section) for the following aircraft:</P>
<P>(1) Transport category large airplanes.</P>
<P>(2) Jet (Turbojet powered) airplanes (regardless of category). For airplanes to which this paragraph applies, âacoustical changesâ do not include changes in type design that are limited to one of the followingâ</P>
<P>(i) Gear down flight with one or more retractable landing gear down during the entire flight, or</P>
<P>(ii) Spare engine and nacelle carriage external to the skin of the airplane (and return of the pylon or other external mount), or</P>
<P>(iii) Time-limited engine and/or nacelle changes, where the change in type design specifies that the airplane may not be operated for a period of more than 90 days unless compliance with the applicable acoustical change provisions of Part 36 of this chapter is shown for that change in type design.</P>
<P>(3) Propeller driven commuter category and small airplanes in the primary, normal, utility, acrobatic, transport, and restricted categories, except for airplanes that are:</P>
<P>(i) Designated for âagricultural aircraft operationsâ (as defined in Â§ 137.3 of this chapter, effective January 1, 1966) to which Â§ 36.1583 of this chapter does not apply, or</P>
<P>(ii) Designated for dispensing fire fighting materials to which Â§ 36.1583 of this chapter does not apply, or</P>
<P>(iii) U.S. registered, and that had flight time prior to January 1, 1955 or</P>
<P>(iv) Land configured aircraft reconfigured with floats or skis. This reconfiguration does not permit further exception from the requirements of this section upon any acoustical change not enumerated in Â§ 21.93(b).</P>
<P>(4) Helicopters except:</P>
<P>(i) Those helicopters that are designated exclusively:</P>
<P>(A) For âagricultural aircraft operationsâ, as defined in Â§ 137.3 of this chapter, as effective on January 1, 1966;</P>
<P>(B) For dispensing fire fighting materials; or</P>
<P>(C) For carrying external loads, as defined in Â§ 133.1(b) of this chapter, as effective on December 20, 1976.</P>
<P>(ii) Those helicopters modified by installation or removal of external equipment. For purposes of this paragraph, âexternal equipmentâ means any instrument, mechanism, part, apparatus, appurtenance, or accessory that is attached to, or extends from, the helicopter exterior but is not used nor is intended to be used in operating or controlling a helicopter in flight and is not part of an airframe or engine. An âacoustical changeâ does not include:</P>
<P>(A) Addition or removal of external equipment;</P>
<P>(B) Changes in the airframe made to accommodate the addition or removal of external equipment, to provide for an external load attaching means, to facilitate the use of external equipment or external loads, or to facilitate the safe operation of the helicopter with external equipment mounted to, or external loads carried by, the helicopter;</P>
<P>(C) Reconfiguration of the helicopter by the addition or removal of floats and skis;</P>
<P>(D) Flight with one or more doors and/or windows removed or in an open position; or</P>
<P>(E) Any changes in the operational limitations placed on the helicopter as a consequence of the addition or removal of external equipment, floats, and skis, or flight operations with doors and/or windows removed or in an open position.</P>
<P>(5) Tiltrotors.</P>
<P>(c) For purposes of complying with part 34 of this chapter, any voluntary change in the type design of the airplane or engine which may increase fuel venting or exhaust emissions is an âemissions change.â</P>

<XREF ID="20161230" REFID="50">Link to an amendment published at 81 FR 96689, Dec. 30, 2016.</XREF>
<P>(a) An applicant for a change to a type certificate must show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with the airworthiness requirements applicable to the category of the product in effect on the date of the application for the change and with parts 34 and 36 of this chapter. Exceptions are detailed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
<P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, if paragraphs (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section apply, an applicant may show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with an earlier amendment of a regulation required by paragraph (a) of this section, and of any other regulation the FAA finds is directly related. However, the earlier amended regulation may not precede either the corresponding regulation incorporated by reference in the type certificate, or any regulation in Â§Â§ 23.2, 25.2, 27.2, or 29.2 of this subchapter that is related to the change. The applicant may show compliance with an earlier amendment of a regulation for any of the following:</P>
<P>(1) A change that the FAA finds not to be significant. In determining whether a specific change is significant, the FAA considers the change in context with all previous relevant design changes and all related revisions to the applicable regulations incorporated in the type certificate for the product. Changes that meet one of the following criteria are automatically considered significant:</P>
<P>(i) The general configuration or the principles of construction are not retained.</P>
<P>(ii) The assumptions used for certification of the product to be changed do not remain valid.</P>
<P>(2) Each area, system, component, equipment, or appliance that the FAA finds is not affected by the change.</P>
<P>(3) Each area, system, component, equipment, or appliance that is affected by the change, for which the FAA finds that compliance with a regulation described in paragraph (a) of this section would not contribute materially to the level of safety of the product or would be impractical.</P>
<P>(c) An applicant for a change to an aircraft (other than a rotorcraft) of 6,000 pounds or less maximum weight, or to a non-turbine rotorcraft of 3,000 pounds or less maximum weight may show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with the regulations incorporated by reference in the type certificate. However, if the FAA finds that the change is significant in an area, the FAA may designate compliance with an amendment to the regulation incorporated by reference in the type certificate that applies to the change and any regulation that the FAA finds is directly related, unless the FAA also finds that compliance with that amendment or regulation would not contribute materially to the level of safety of the product or would be impractical.</P>
<P>(d) If the FAA finds that the regulations in effect on the date of the application for the change do not provide adequate standards with respect to the proposed change because of a novel or unusual design feature, the applicant must also comply with special conditions, and amendments to those special conditions, prescribed under the provisions of Â§ 21.16, to provide a level of safety equal to that established by the regulations in effect on the date of the application for the change.</P>
<P>(e) An application for a change to a type certificate for a transport category aircraft is effective for 5 years, and an application for a change to any other type certificate is effective for 3 years. If the change has not been approved, or if it is clear that it will not be approved under the time limit established under this paragraph, the applicant may do either of the following:</P>
<P>(1) File a new application for a change to the type certificate and comply with all the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section applicable to an original application for a change.</P>
<P>(2) File for an extension of the original application and comply with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. The applicant must then select a new application date. The new application date may not precede the date the change is approved by more than the time period established under this paragraph (e).</P>
<P>(f) For aircraft certificated under Â§Â§ 21.17(b), 21.24, 21.25, and 21.27 the airworthiness requirements applicable to the category of the product in effect on the date of the application for the change include each airworthiness requirement that the FAA finds to be appropriate for the type certification of the aircraft in accordance with those sections.</P>
<P>(g) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, for transport category airplanes, the applicant must show compliance with each applicable provision of part 26 of this chapter, unless the applicant has elected or was required to comply with a corresponding amendment to part 25 of this chapter that was issued on or after the date of the applicable part 26 provision.</P>

<P>(a) An applicant for a change to a type certificate must show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with the airworthiness requirements applicable to the category of the product in effect on the date of the application for the change and with parts 34 and 36 of this chapter. Exceptions are detailed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
<P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, if paragraphs (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section apply, an applicant may show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with an earlier amendment of a regulation required by paragraph (a) of this section, and of any other regulation the FAA finds is directly related. However, the earlier amended regulation may not precede either the corresponding regulation incorporated by reference in the type certificate, or any regulation in Â§Â§ 23.2, 25.2, 27.2, or 29.2 of this subchapter that is related to the change. The applicant may show compliance with an earlier amendment of a regulation for any of the following:</P>
<P>(1) A change that the FAA finds not to be significant. In determining whether a specific change is significant, the FAA considers the change in context with all previous relevant design changes and all related revisions to the applicable regulations incorporated in the type certificate for the product. Changes that meet one of the following criteria are automatically considered significant:</P>
<P>(i) The general configuration or the principles of construction are not retained.</P>
<P>(ii) The assumptions used for certification of the product to be changed do not remain valid.</P>
<P>(2) Each area, system, component, equipment, or appliance that the FAA finds is not affected by the change.</P>
<P>(3) Each area, system, component, equipment, or appliance that is affected by the change, for which the FAA finds that compliance with a regulation described in paragraph (a) of this section would not contribute materially to the level of safety of the product or would be impractical.</P>
<P>(c) An applicant for a change to an aircraft (other than a rotorcraft) of 6,000 pounds or less maximum weight, or to a non-turbine rotorcraft of 3,000 pounds or less maximum weight may show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with the regulations incorporated by reference in the type certificate. However, if the FAA finds that the change is significant in an area, the FAA may designate compliance with an amendment to the regulation incorporated by reference in the type certificate that applies to the change and any regulation that the FAA finds is directly related, unless the FAA also finds that compliance with that amendment or regulation would not contribute materially to the level of safety of the product or would be impractical.</P>
<P>(d) If the FAA finds that the regulations in effect on the date of the application for the change do not provide adequate standards with respect to the proposed change because of a novel or unusual design feature, the applicant must also comply with special conditions, and amendments to those special conditions, prescribed under the provisions of Â§ 21.16, to provide a level of safety equal to that established by the regulations in effect on the date of the application for the change.</P>
<P>(e) An application for a change to a type certificate for a transport category aircraft is effective for 5 years, and an application for a change to any other type certificate is effective for 3 years. If the change has not been approved, or if it is clear that it will not be approved under the time limit established under this paragraph, the applicant may do either of the following:</P>
<P>(1) File a new application for a change to the type certificate and comply with all the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section applicable to an original application for a change.</P>
<P>(2) File for an extension of the original application and comply with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. The applicant must then select a new application date. The new application date may not precede the date the change is approved by more than the time period established under this paragraph (e).</P>
<P>(f) For aircraft certificated under Â§Â§ 21.17(b), 21.24, 21.25, and 21.27 the airworthiness requirements applicable to the category of the product in effect on the date of the application for the change include each airworthiness requirement that the FAA finds to be appropriate for the type certification of the aircraft in accordance with those sections.</P>
<P>(g) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, for transport category airplanes, the applicant must show compliance with each applicable provision of part 26 of this chapter, unless the applicant has elected or was required to comply with a corresponding amendment to part 25 of this chapter that was issued on or after the date of the applicable part 26 provision.</P>

<HEAD>Â§ 21.101 Designation of applicable regulations.</HEAD>
<P>(a) An applicant for a change to a type certificate must show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with the airworthiness requirements applicable to the category of the product in effect on the date of the application for the change and with parts 34 and 36 of this chapter. Exceptions are detailed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
<P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, if paragraphs (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section apply, an applicant may show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with an earlier amendment of a regulation required by paragraph (a) of this section, and of any other regulation the FAA finds is directly related. However, the earlier amended regulation may not precede either the corresponding regulation included by reference in the type certificate, or any regulation in Â§Â§ 25.2, 27.2, or 29.2 of this chapter that is related to the change. The applicant may show compliance with an earlier amendment of a regulation for any of the following:</P>
<P>(1) A change that the FAA finds not to be significant. In determining whether a specific change is significant, the FAA considers the change in context with all previous relevant design changes and all related revisions to the applicable regulations incorporated in the type certificate for the product. Changes that meet one of the following criteria are automatically considered significant:</P>
<P>(i) The general configuration or the principles of construction are not retained.</P>
<P>(ii) The assumptions used for certification of the product to be changed do not remain valid.</P>
<P>(2) Each area, system, component, equipment, or appliance that the FAA finds is not affected by the change.</P>
<P>(3) Each area, system, component, equipment, or appliance that is affected by the change, for which the FAA finds that compliance with a regulation described in paragraph (a) of this section would not contribute materially to the level of safety of the product or would be impractical.</P>
<P>(c) An applicant for a change to an aircraft (other than a rotorcraft) of 6,000 pounds or less maximum weight, to a non-turbine rotorcraft of 3,000 pounds or less maximum weight, to a level 1 low-speed airplane, or to a level 2 low-speed airplane may show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with the regulations included in the type certificate. However, if the FAA finds that the change is significant in an area, the FAA may designate compliance with an amendment to the regulation incorporated by reference in the type certificate that applies to the change and any regulation that the FAA finds is directly related, unless the FAA also finds that compliance with that amendment or regulation would not contribute materially to the level of safety of the product or would be impractical.</P>
<P>(d) If the FAA finds that the regulations in effect on the date of the application for the change do not provide adequate standards with respect to the proposed change because of a novel or unusual design feature, the applicant must also comply with special conditions, and amendments to those special conditions, prescribed under the provisions of Â§ 21.16, to provide a level of safety equal to that established by the regulations in effect on the date of the application for the change.</P>
<P>(e) An application for a change to a type certificate for a transport category aircraft is effective for 5 years, and an application for a change to any other type certificate is effective for 3 years. If the change has not been approved, or if it is clear that it will not be approved under the time limit established under this paragraph, the applicant may do either of the following:</P>
<P>(1) File a new application for a change to the type certificate and comply with all the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section applicable to an original application for a change.</P>
<P>(2) File for an extension of the original application and comply with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. The applicant must then select a new application date. The new application date may not precede the date the change is approved by more than the time period established under this paragraph (e).</P>
<P>(f) For aircraft certificated under Â§Â§ 21.17(b), 21.24, 21.25, and 21.27 the airworthiness requirements applicable to the category of the product in effect on the date of the application for the change include each airworthiness requirement that the FAA finds to be appropriate for the type certification of the aircraft in accordance with those sections.</P>
<P>(g) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, for transport category airplanes, the applicant must show compliance with each applicable provision of part 26 of this chapter, unless the applicant has elected or was required to comply with a corresponding amendment to part 25 of this chapter that was issued on or after the date of the applicable part 26 provision.</P>

<HEAD>Â§ 21.93 Classification of changes in type design.</HEAD>
<P>(a) In addition to changes in type design specified in paragraph (b) of this section, changes in type design are classified as minor and major. A âminor changeâ is one that has no appreciable effect on the weight, balance, structural strength, reliability, operational characteristics, or other characteristics affecting the airworthiness of the product. All other changes are âmajor changesâ (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section).</P>
<P>(b) For the purpose of complying with Part 36 of this chapter, and except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section, any voluntary change in the type design of an aircraft that may increase the noise levels of that aircraft is an âacoustical changeâ (in addition to being a minor or major change as classified in paragraph (a) of this section) for the following aircraft:</P>
<P>(1) Transport category large airplanes.</P>
<P>(2) Jet (Turbojet powered) airplanes (regardless of category). For airplanes to which this paragraph applies, âacoustical changesâ do not include changes in type design that are limited to one of the followingâ</P>
<P>(i) Gear down flight with one or more retractable landing gear down during the entire flight, or</P>
<P>(ii) Spare engine and nacelle carriage external to the skin of the airplane (and return of the pylon or other external mount), or</P>
<P>(iii) Time-limited engine and/or nacelle changes, where the change in type design specifies that the airplane may not be operated for a period of more than 90 days unless compliance with the applicable acoustical change provisions of Part 36 of this chapter is shown for that change in type design.</P>
<P>(3) Propeller driven commuter category and small airplanes in the primary, normal, utility, acrobatic, transport, and restricted categories, except for airplanes that are:</P>
<P>(i) Designated for âagricultural aircraft operationsâ (as defined in Â§ 137.3 of this chapter, effective January 1, 1966) to which Â§ 36.1583 of this chapter does not apply, or</P>
<P>(ii) Designated for dispensing fire fighting materials to which Â§ 36.1583 of this chapter does not apply, or</P>
<P>(iii) U.S. registered, and that had flight time prior to January 1, 1955 or</P>
<P>(iv) Land configured aircraft reconfigured with floats or skis. This reconfiguration does not permit further exception from the requirements of this section upon any acoustical change not enumerated in Â§ 21.93(b).</P>
<P>(4) Helicopters except:</P>
<P>(i) Those helicopters that are designated exclusively:</P>
<P>(A) For âagricultural aircraft operationsâ, as defined in Â§ 137.3 of this chapter, as effective on January 1, 1966;</P>
<P>(B) For dispensing fire fighting materials; or</P>
<P>(C) For carrying external loads, as defined in Â§ 133.1(b) of this chapter, as effective on December 20, 1976.</P>
<P>(ii) Those helicopters modified by installation or removal of external equipment. For purposes of this paragraph, âexternal equipmentâ means any instrument, mechanism, part, apparatus, appurtenance, or accessory that is attached to, or extends from, the helicopter exterior but is not used nor is intended to be used in operating or controlling a helicopter in flight and is not part of an airframe or engine. An âacoustical changeâ does not include:</P>
<P>(A) Addition or removal of external equipment;</P>
<P>(B) Changes in the airframe made to accommodate the addition or removal of external equipment, to provide for an external load attaching means, to facilitate the use of external equipment or external loads, or to facilitate the safe operation of the helicopter with external equipment mounted to, or external loads carried by, the helicopter;</P>
<P>(C) Reconfiguration of the helicopter by the addition or removal of floats and skis;</P>
<P>(D) Flight with one or more doors and/or windows removed or in an open position; or</P>
<P>(E) Any changes in the operational limitations placed on the helicopter as a consequence of the addition or removal of external equipment, floats, and skis, or flight operations with doors and/or windows removed or in an open position.</P>
<P>(5) Tiltrotors.</P>
<P>(c) For purposes of complying with part 34 of this chapter, any voluntary change in the type design of the airplane or engine which may increase fuel venting or exhaust emissions is an âemissions change.â</P>

<P>(i) Otherwise specified by the FAA; or</P>
<P>(ii) Compliance with later effective amendments is elected or required under this section; and</P>
<P>(2) Any special conditions prescribed by the FAA.</P>
<P>(b) For special classes of aircraft, including the engines and propellers installed thereon (e.g., gliders, airships, and other nonconventional aircraft), for which airworthiness standards have not been issued under this subchapter, the applicable requirements will be the portions of those other airworthiness requirements contained in Parts 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, and 35 found by the FAA to be appropriate for the aircraft and applicable to a specific type design, or such airworthiness criteria as the FAA may find provide an equivalent level of safety to those parts.</P>
<P>(c) An application for type certification of a transport category aircraft is effective for 5 years and an application for any other type certificate is effective for 3 years, unless an applicant shows at the time of application that his product requires a longer period of time for design, development, and testing, and the FAA approves a longer period.</P>
<P>(d) In a case where a type certificate has not been issued, or it is clear that a type certificate will not be issued, within the time limit established under paragraph (c) of this section, the applicant mayâ</P>
<P>(1) File a new application for a type certificate and comply with all the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section applicable to an original application; or</P>
<P>(2) File for an extension of the original application and comply with the applicable airworthiness requirements of this subchapter that were effective on a date, to be selected by the applicant, not earlier than the date which precedes the date of issue of the type certificate by the time limit established under paragraph (c) of this section for the original application.</P>
<P>(e) If an applicant elects to comply with an amendment to this subchapter that is effective after the filing of the application for a type certificate, he must also comply with any other amendment that the FAA finds is directly related.</P>
<P>(f) For primary category aircraft, the requirements are:</P>
<P>(1) The applicable airworthiness requirements contained in parts 23, 27, 31, 33, and 35 of this subchapter, or such other airworthiness criteria as the FAA may find appropriate and applicable to the specific design and intended use and provide a level of safety acceptable to the FAA.</P>
<P>(2) The noise standards of part 36 applicable to primary category aircraft.</P>

<HEAD>Â§ 21.4 ETOPS reporting requirements.</HEAD>
<P>(a) <I>Early ETOPS: reporting, tracking, and resolving problems.</I> The holder of a type certificate for an airplane-engine combination approved using the Early ETOPS method specified in part 25, Appendix K, of this chapter must use a system for reporting, tracking, and resolving each problem resulting in one of the occurrences specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.</P>
<P>(1) The system must identify how the type certificate holder will promptly identify problems, report them to the responsible Aircraft Certification Service office, and propose a solution to the FAA to resolve each problem. A proposed solution must consist ofâ</P>
<P>(i) A change in the airplane or engine type design;</P>
<P>(ii) A change in a manufacturing process;</P>
<P>(iii) A change in an operating or maintenance procedure; or</P>
<P>(iv) Any other solution acceptable to the FAA.</P>
<P>(2) For an airplane with more than two engines, the system must be in place for the first 250,000 world fleet engine-hours for the approved airplane-engine combination.</P>
<P>(3) For two-engine airplanes, the system must be in place for the first 250,000 world fleet engine-hours for the approved airplane-engine combination and after that untilâ</P>
<P>(i) The world fleet 12-month rolling average IFSD rate is at or below the rate required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section; and</P>
<P>(ii) The FAA determines that the rate is stable.</P>
<P>(4) For an airplane-engine combination that is a derivative of an airplane-engine combination previously approved for ETOPS, the system need only address those problems specified in the following table, provided the type certificate holder obtains prior authorization from the FAA:</P>

<P>(b) <I>Reliability of two-engine airplanes</I>â(1) <I>Reporting of two-engine airplane in-service reliability.</I> The holder of a type certificate for an airplane approved for ETOPS and the holder of a type certificate for an engine installed on an airplane approved for ETOPS must report monthly to their respective Aircraft Certification Service office on the reliability of the world fleet of those airplanes and engines. The report provided by both the airplane and engine type certificate holders must address each airplane-engine combination approved for ETOPS. The FAA may approve quarterly reporting if the airplane-engine combination demonstrates an IFSD rate at or below those specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for a period acceptable to the FAA. This reporting may be combined with the reporting required by Â§ 21.3. The responsible type certificate holder must investigate any cause of an IFSD resulting from an occurrence attributable to the design of its product and report the results of that investigation to its responsible Aircraft Certification Service office. Reporting must include:</P>
<P>(i) Engine IFSDs, except planned IFSDs performed for flight training.</P>
<P>(ii) The world fleet 12-month rolling average IFSD rates for all causes, except planned IFSDs performed for flight training.</P>
<P>(iii) ETOPS fleet utilization, including a list of operators, their ETOPS diversion time authority, flight hours, and cycles.</P>
<P>(2) <I>World fleet IFSD rate for two-engine airplanes.</I> The holder of a type certificate for an airplane approved for ETOPS and the holder of a type certificate for an engine installed on an airplane approved for ETOPS must issue service information to the operators of those airplanes and engines, as appropriate, to maintain the world fleet 12-month rolling average IFSD rate at or below the following levels:</P>
<P>(i) A rate of 0.05 per 1,000 world-fleet engine-hours for an airplane-engine combination approved for up to and including 120-minute ETOPS. When all ETOPS operators have complied with the corrective actions required in the configuration, maintenance and procedures (CMP) document as a condition for ETOPS approval, the rate to be maintained is at or below 0.02 per 1,000 world-fleet engine-hours.</P>
<P>(ii) A rate of 0.02 per 1,000 world-fleet engine-hours for an airplane-engine combination approved for up to and including 180-minute ETOPS, including airplane-engine combinations approved for 207-minute ETOPS in the North Pacific operating area under appendix P, section I, paragraph (h), of part 121 of this chapter.</P>
<P>(iii) A rate of 0.01 per 1,000 world-fleet engine-hours for an airplane-engine combination approved for ETOPS beyond 180 minutes, excluding airplane-engine combinations approved for 207-minute ETOPS in the North Pacific operating area under appendix P, section I, paragraph (h), of part 121 of this chapter.</P>

All other changes are âmajor changesâ (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section).</P>
<P>(b) For the purpose of complying with Part 36 of this chapter, and except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section, any voluntary change in the type design of an aircraft that may increase the noise levels of that aircraft is an âacoustical changeâ (in addition to being a minor or major change as classified in paragraph (a) of this section) for the following aircraft:</P>
<P>(1) Transport category large airplanes.</P>
<P>(2) Jet (Turbojet powered) airplanes (regardless of category). For airplanes to which this paragraph applies, âacoustical changesâ do not include changes in type design that are limited to one of the followingâ</P>
<P>(i) Gear down flight with one or more retractable landing gear down during the entire flight, or</P>
<P>(ii) Spare engine and nacelle carriage external to the skin of the airplane (and return of the pylon or other external mount), or</P>
<P>(iii) Time-limited engine and/or nacelle changes, where the change in type design specifies that the airplane may not be operated for a period of more than 90 days unless compliance with the applicable acoustical change provisions of Part 36 of this chapter is shown for that change in type design.</P>
<P>(3) Propeller driven commuter category and small airplanes in the primary, normal, utility, acrobatic, transport, and restricted categories, except for airplanes that are:</P>
<P>(i) Designated for âagricultural aircraft operationsâ (as defined in Â§ 137.3 of this chapter, effective January 1, 1966) to which Â§ 36.1583 of this chapter does not apply, or</P>
<P>(ii) Designated for dispensing fire fighting materials to which Â§ 36.1583 of this chapter does not apply, or</P>
<P>(iii) U.S. registered, and that had flight time prior to January 1, 1955 or</P>
<P>(iv) Land configured aircraft reconfigured with floats or skis. This reconfiguration does not permit further exception from the requirements of this section upon any acoustical change not enumerated in Â§ 21.93(b).</P>
<P>(4) Helicopters except:</P>
<P>(i) Those helicopters that are designated exclusively:</P>
<P>(A) For âagricultural aircraft operationsâ, as defined in Â§ 137.3 of this chapter, as effective on January 1, 1966;</P>
<P>(B) For dispensing fire fighting materials; or</P>
<P>(C) For carrying external loads, as defined in Â§ 133.1(b) of this chapter, as effective on December 20, 1976.</P>
<P>(ii) Those helicopters modified by installation or removal of external equipment. For purposes of this paragraph, âexternal equipmentâ means any instrument, mechanism, part, apparatus, appurtenance, or accessory that is attached to, or extends from, the helicopter exterior but is not used nor is intended to be used in operating or controlling a helicopter in flight and is not part of an airframe or engine. An âacoustical changeâ does not include:</P>
<P>(A) Addition or removal of external equipment;</P>
<P>(B) Changes in the airframe made to accommodate the addition or removal of external equipment, to provide for an external load attaching means, to facilitate the use of external equipment or external loads, or to facilitate the safe operation of the helicopter with external equipment mounted to, or external loads carried by, the helicopter;</P>
<P>(C) Reconfiguration of the helicopter by the addition or removal of floats and skis;</P>
<P>(D) Flight with one or more doors and/or windows removed or in an open position; or</P>
<P>(E) Any changes in the operational limitations placed on the helicopter as a consequence of the addition or removal of external equipment, floats, and skis, or flight operations with doors and/or windows removed or in an open position.</P>
<P>(5) Tiltrotors.</P>
<P>(c) For purposes of complying with part 34 of this chapter, any voluntary change in the type design of the airplane or engine which may increase fuel venting or exhaust emissions is an âemissions change.â</P>

<P>(a) In addition to changes in type design specified in paragraph (b) of this section, changes in type design are classified as minor and major. A âminor changeâ is one that has no appreciable effect on the weight, balance, structural strength, reliability, operational characteristics, or other characteristics affecting the airworthiness of the product. All other changes are âmajor changesâ (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section).</P>
<P>(b) For the purpose of complying with Part 36 of this chapter, and except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section, any voluntary change in the type design of an aircraft that may increase the noise levels of that aircraft is an âacoustical changeâ (in addition to being a minor or major change as classified in paragraph (a) of this section) for the following aircraft:</P>
<P>(1) Transport category large airplanes.</P>
<P>(2) Jet (Turbojet powered) airplanes (regardless of category). For airplanes to which this paragraph applies, âacoustical changesâ do not include changes in type design that are limited to one of the followingâ</P>
<P>(i) Gear down flight with one or more retractable landing gear down during the entire flight, or</P>
<P>(ii) Spare engine and nacelle carriage external to the skin of the airplane (and return of the pylon or other external mount), or</P>
<P>(iii) Time-limited engine and/or nacelle changes, where the change in type design specifies that the airplane may not be operated for a period of more than 90 days unless compliance with the applicable acoustical change provisions of Part 36 of this chapter is shown for that change in type design.</P>
<P>(3) Propeller driven commuter category and small airplanes in the primary, normal, utility, acrobatic, transport, and restricted categories, except for airplanes that are:</P>
<P>(i) Designated for âagricultural aircraft operationsâ (as defined in Â§ 137.3 of this chapter, effective January 1, 1966) to which Â§ 36.1583 of this chapter does not apply, or</P>
<P>(ii) Designated for dispensing fire fighting materials to which Â§ 36.1583 of this chapter does not apply, or</P>
<P>(iii) U.S. registered, and that had flight time prior to January 1, 1955 or</P>
<P>(iv) Land configured aircraft reconfigured with floats or skis. This reconfiguration does not permit further exception from the requirements of this section upon any acoustical change not enumerated in Â§ 21.93(b).</P>
<P>(4) Helicopters except:</P>
<P>(i) Those helicopters that are designated exclusively:</P>
<P>(A) For âagricultural aircraft operationsâ, as defined in Â§ 137.3 of this chapter, as effective on January 1, 1966;</P>
<P>(B) For dispensing fire fighting materials; or</P>
<P>(C) For carrying external loads, as defined in Â§ 133.1(b) of this chapter, as effective on December 20, 1976.</P>
<P>(ii) Those helicopters modified by installation or removal of external equipment. For purposes of this paragraph, âexternal equipmentâ means any instrument, mechanism, part, apparatus, appurtenance, or accessory that is attached to, or extends from, the helicopter exterior but is not used nor is intended to be used in operating or controlling a helicopter in flight and is not part of an airframe or engine. An âacoustical changeâ does not include:</P>
<P>(A) Addition or removal of external equipment;</P>
<P>(B) Changes in the airframe made to accommodate the addition or removal of external equipment, to provide for an external load attaching means, to facilitate the use of external equipment or external loads, or to facilitate the safe operation of the helicopter with external equipment mounted to, or external loads carried by, the helicopter;</P>
<P>(C) Reconfiguration of the helicopter by the addition or removal of floats and skis;</P>
<P>(D) Flight with one or more doors and/or windows removed or in an open position; or</P>
<P>(E) Any changes in the operational limitations placed on the helicopter as a consequence of the addition or removal of external equipment, floats, and skis, or flight operations with doors and/or windows removed or in an open position.</P>
<P>(5) Tiltrotors.</P>
<P>(c) For purposes of complying with part 34 of this chapter, any voluntary change in the type design of the airplane or engine which may increase fuel venting or exhaust emissions is an âemissions change.â</P>

<P>(a) An applicant for a change to a type certificate must show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with the airworthiness requirements applicable to the category of the product in effect on the date of the application for the change and with parts 34 and 36 of this chapter. Exceptions are detailed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
<P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, if paragraphs (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section apply, an applicant may show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with an earlier amendment of a regulation required by paragraph (a) of this section, and of any other regulation the FAA finds is directly related. However, the earlier amended regulation may not precede either the corresponding regulation included by reference in the type certificate, or any regulation in Â§Â§ 25.2, 27.2, or 29.2 of this chapter that is related to the change. The applicant may show compliance with an earlier amendment of a regulation for any of the following:</P>
<P>(1) A change that the FAA finds not to be significant. In determining whether a specific change is significant, the FAA considers the change in context with all previous relevant design changes and all related revisions to the applicable regulations incorporated in the type certificate for the product. Changes that meet one of the following criteria are automatically considered significant:</P>
<P>(i) The general configuration or the principles of construction are not retained.</P>
<P>(ii) The assumptions used for certification of the product to be changed do not remain valid.</P>
<P>(2) Each area, system, component, equipment, or appliance that the FAA finds is not affected by the change.</P>
<P>(3) Each area, system, component, equipment, or appliance that is affected by the change, for which the FAA finds that compliance with a regulation described in paragraph (a) of this section would not contribute materially to the level of safety of the product or would be impractical.</P>
<P>(c) An applicant for a change to an aircraft (other than a rotorcraft) of 6,000 pounds or less maximum weight, to a non-turbine rotorcraft of 3,000 pounds or less maximum weight, to a level 1 low-speed airplane, or to a level 2 low-speed airplane may show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with the regulations included in the type certificate. However, if the FAA finds that the change is significant in an area, the FAA may designate compliance with an amendment to the regulation incorporated by reference in the type certificate that applies to the change and any regulation that the FAA finds is directly related, unless the FAA also finds that compliance with that amendment or regulation would not contribute materially to the level of safety of the product or would be impractical.</P>
<P>(d) If the FAA finds that the regulations in effect on the date of the application for the change do not provide adequate standards with respect to the proposed change because of a novel or unusual design feature, the applicant must also comply with special conditions, and amendments to those special conditions, prescribed under the provisions of Â§ 21.16, to provide a level of safety equal to that established by the regulations in effect on the date of the application for the change.</P>
<P>(e) An application for a change to a type certificate for a transport category aircraft is effective for 5 years, and an application for a change to any other type certificate is effective for 3 years. If the change has not been approved, or if it is clear that it will not be approved under the time limit established under this paragraph, the applicant may do either of the following:</P>
<P>(1) File a new application for a change to the type certificate and comply with all the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section applicable to an original application for a change.</P>
<P>(2) File for an extension of the original application and comply with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. The applicant must then select a new application date. The new application date may not precede the date the change is approved by more than the time period established under this paragraph (e).</P>
<P>(f) For aircraft certificated under Â§Â§ 21.17(b), 21.24, 21.25, and 21.27 the airworthiness requirements applicable to the category of the product in effect on the date of the application for the change include each airworthiness requirement that the FAA finds to be appropriate for the type certification of the aircraft in accordance with those sections.</P>
<P>(g) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, for transport category airplanes, the applicant must show compliance with each applicable provision of part 26 of this chapter, unless the applicant has elected or was required to comply with a corresponding amendment to part 25 of this chapter that was issued on or after the date of the applicable part 26 provision.</P>

<HEAD>Â§ 21.93 Classification of changes in type design.</HEAD>
<P>(a) In addition to changes in type design specified in paragraph (b) of this section, changes in type design are classified as minor and major. A âminor changeâ is one that has no appreciable effect on the weight, balance, structural strength, reliability, operational characteristics, or other characteristics affecting the airworthiness of the product. All other changes are âmajor changesâ (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section).</P>
<P>(b) For the purpose of complying with Part 36 of this chapter, and except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(4) of this section, any voluntary change in the type design of an aircraft that may increase the noise levels of that aircraft is an âacoustical changeâ (in addition to being a minor or major change as classified in paragraph (a) of this section) for the following aircraft:</P>
<P>(1) Transport category large airplanes.</P>
<P>(2) Jet (Turbojet powered) airplanes (regardless of category). For airplanes to which this paragraph applies, âacoustical changesâ do not include changes in type design that are limited to one of the followingâ</P>
<P>(i) Gear down flight with one or more retractable landing gear down during the entire flight, or</P>
<P>(ii) Spare engine and nacelle carriage external to the skin of the airplane (and return of the pylon or other external mount), or</P>
<P>(iii) Time-limited engine and/or nacelle changes, where the change in type design specifies that the airplane may not be operated for a period of more than 90 days unless compliance with the applicable acoustical change provisions of Part 36 of this chapter is shown for that change in type design.</P>
<P>(3) Propeller driven commuter category and small airplanes in the primary, normal, utility, acrobatic, transport, and restricted categories, except for airplanes that are:</P>
<P>(i) Designated for âagricultural aircraft operationsâ (as defined in Â§ 137.3 of this chapter, effective January 1, 1966) to which Â§ 36.1583 of this chapter does not apply, or</P>
<P>(ii) Designated for dispensing fire fighting materials to which Â§ 36.1583 of this chapter does not apply, or</P>
<P>(iii) U.S. registered, and that had flight time prior to January 1, 1955 or</P>
<P>(iv) Land configured aircraft reconfigured with floats or skis. This reconfiguration does not permit further exception from the requirements of this section upon any acoustical change not enumerated in Â§ 21.93(b).</P>
<P>(4) Helicopters except:</P>
<P>(i) Those helicopters that are designated exclusively:</P>
<P>(A) For âagricultural aircraft operationsâ, as defined in Â§ 137.3 of this chapter, as effective on January 1, 1966;</P>
<P>(B) For dispensing fire fighting materials; or</P>
<P>(C) For carrying external loads, as defined in Â§ 133.1(b) of this chapter, as effective on December 20, 1976.</P>
<P>(ii) Those helicopters modified by installation or removal of external equipment. For purposes of this paragraph, âexternal equipmentâ means any instrument, mechanism, part, apparatus, appurtenance, or accessory that is attached to, or extends from, the helicopter exterior but is not used nor is intended to be used in operating or controlling a helicopter in flight and is not part of an airframe or engine. An âacoustical changeâ does not include:</P>
<P>(A) Addition or removal of external equipment;</P>
<P>(B) Changes in the airframe made to accommodate the addition or removal of external equipment, to provide for an external load attaching means, to facilitate the use of external equipment or external loads, or to facilitate the safe operation of the helicopter with external equipment mounted to, or external loads carried by, the helicopter;</P>
<P>(C) Reconfiguration of the helicopter by the addition or removal of floats and skis;</P>
<P>(D) Flight with one or more doors and/or windows removed or in an open position; or</P>
<P>(E) Any changes in the operational limitations placed on the helicopter as a consequence of the addition or removal of external equipment, floats, and skis, or flight operations with doors and/or windows removed or in an open position.</P>
<P>(5) Tiltrotors.</P>
<P>(c) For purposes of complying with part 34 of this chapter, any voluntary change in the type design of the airplane or engine which may increase fuel venting or exhaust emissions is an âemissions change.â</P>
<P>(d) For the purpose of maintaining compliance with part 38 of this chapter, any voluntary change in the type design of an airplane that may increase the fuel efficiency metric value or the MTOM of that airplane is a âfuel efficiency changeâ, in addition to being a minor or major change as classified in paragraph (a) of this section.</P>

Exceptions are detailed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</P>
<P>(b) Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, if paragraphs (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section apply, an applicant may show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with an earlier amendment of a regulation required by paragraph (a) of this section, and of any other regulation the FAA finds is directly related. However, the earlier amended regulation may not precede either the corresponding regulation included by reference in the type certificate, or any regulation in Â§Â§ 25.2, 27.2, or 29.2 of this chapter that is related to the change. The applicant may show compliance with an earlier amendment of a regulation for any of the following:</P>
<P>(1) A change that the FAA finds not to be significant. In determining whether a specific change is significant, the FAA considers the change in context with all previous relevant design changes and all related revisions to the applicable regulations incorporated in the type certificate for the product. Changes that meet one of the following criteria are automatically considered significant:</P>
<P>(i) The general configuration or the principles of construction are not retained.</P>
<P>(ii) The assumptions used for certification of the product to be changed do not remain valid.</P>
<P>(2) Each area, system, component, equipment, or appliance that the FAA finds is not affected by the change.</P>
<P>(3) Each area, system, component, equipment, or appliance that is affected by the change, for which the FAA finds that compliance with a regulation described in paragraph (a) of this section would not contribute materially to the level of safety of the product or would be impractical.</P>
<P>(c) An applicant for a change to an aircraft (other than a rotorcraft) of 6,000 pounds or less maximum weight, to a non-turbine rotorcraft of 3,000 pounds or less maximum weight, to a level 1 low-speed airplane, or to a level 2 low-speed airplane may show that the change and areas affected by the change comply with the regulations included in the type certificate. However, if the FAA finds that the change is significant in an area, the FAA may designate compliance with an amendment to the regulation incorporated by reference in the type certificate that applies to the change and any regulation that the FAA finds is directly related, unless the FAA also finds that compliance with that amendment or regulation would not contribute materially to the level of safety of the product or would be impractical.</P>
<P>(d) If the FAA finds that the regulations in effect on the date of the application for the change do not provide adequate standards with respect to the proposed change because of a novel or unusual design feature, the applicant must also comply with special conditions, and amendments to those special conditions, prescribed under the provisions of Â§ 21.16, to provide a level of safety equal to that established by the regulations in effect on the date of the application for the change.</P>
<P>(e) An application for a change to a type certificate for a transport category aircraft is effective for 5 years, and an application for a change to any other type certificate is effective for 3 years. If the change has not been approved, or if it is clear that it will not be approved under the time limit established under this paragraph, the applicant may do either of the following:</P>
<P>(1) File a new application for a change to the type certificate and comply with all the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section applicable to an original application for a change.</P>
<P>(2) File for an extension of the original application and comply with the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section. The applicant must then select a new application date. The new application date may not precede the date the change is approved by more than the time period established under this paragraph (e).</P>
<P>(f) For aircraft certificated under Â§Â§ 21.17(b), 21.24, 21.25, and 21.27 the airworthiness requirements applicable to the category of the product in effect on the date of the application for the change include each airworthiness requirement that the FAA finds to be appropriate for the type certification of the aircraft in accordance with those sections.</P>
<P>(g) Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, for transport category airplanes, the applicant must show compliance with each applicable provision of part 26 of this chapter, unless the applicant has elected or was required to comply with a corresponding amendment to part 25 of this chapter that was issued on or after the date of the applicable part 26 provision.</P>

The FAA may approve quarterly reporting if the airplane-engine combination demonstrates an IFSD rate at or below those specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for a period acceptable to the FAA. This reporting may be combined with the reporting required by Â§ 21.3. The responsible type certificate holder must investigate any cause of an IFSD resulting from an occurrence attributable to the design of its product and report the results of that investigation to its responsible Aircraft Certification Service office. Reporting must include:</P>
<P>(i) Engine IFSDs, except planned IFSDs performed for flight training.</P>
<P>(ii) The world fleet 12-month rolling average IFSD rates for all causes, except planned IFSDs performed for flight training.</P>
<P>(iii) ETOPS fleet utilization, including a list of operators, their ETOPS diversion time authority, flight hours, and cycles.</P>
<P>(2) <I>World fleet IFSD rate for two-engine airplanes.</I> The holder of a type certificate for an airplane approved for ETOPS and the holder of a type certificate for an engine installed on an airplane approved for ETOPS must issue service information to the operators of those airplanes and engines, as appropriate, to maintain the world fleet 12-month rolling average IFSD rate at or below the following levels:</P>
<P>(i) A rate of 0.05 per 1,000 world-fleet engine-hours for an airplane-engine combination approved for up to and including 120-minute ETOPS. When all ETOPS operators have complied with the corrective actions required in the configuration, maintenance and procedures (CMP) document as a condition for ETOPS approval, the rate to be maintained is at or below 0.02 per 1,000 world-fleet engine-hours.</P>
<P>(ii) A rate of 0.02 per 1,000 world-fleet engine-hours for an airplane-engine combination approved for up to and including 180-minute ETOPS, including airplane-engine combinations approved for 207-minute ETOPS in the North Pacific operating area under appendix P, section I, paragraph (h), of part 121 of this chapter.</P>
<P>(iii) A rate of 0.01 per 1,000 world-fleet engine-hours for an airplane-engine combination approved for ETOPS beyond 180 minutes, excluding airplane-engine combinations approved for 207-minute ETOPS in the North Pacific operating area under appendix P, section I, paragraph (h), of part 121 of this chapter.</P>

## Interpretation Provision for Part V Standards

In these Standards:

1. (a) The passages giving the Minister power to determine, approve, establish or authorise something without stating criteria for the use of such power are to be interpreted as requiring that the power be used in consideration of two factors only: the airworthiness of the aircraft that is the subject of the determination, approval or authorisation, or on which an aeronautical product that is the subject of the determination, approval or authorisation is to be installed, and the aircraft's level of safety;
2. (b) the word “approved” or “authorised”, when used without an indication of a method of approval or authorisation, is to be interpreted as referring to an approval or an authorisation granted under the Aeronautics Act.

## Preamble

### General

The content of this chapter is based on the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter I, Part 33 entitled Airworthiness Standards, Aircraft Engines. These United States airworthiness standards have been used and adapted as the model for the Canadian standards supplemented by additional airworthiness requirements based on Canadian experience and required for Canadian aviation purposes.

The FAR numbering system is used. The Canadian standards bear the same number as the FAR equivalent, prefixed by the number “5”, as this chapter contains the standards for Part V of the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs).

**First Edition**

**Effective: January 1, 1986**

The first edition of this chapter is based on FAR Part 33, up to and including amendment 33-10 published in the Federal Register dated February 23, 1984. Except for administrative changes (e.g., Administrator = Minister; Part = Chapter) and the deletion of references to operating FARs, there are no Canadian variations included in this first edition.

The standards in this chapter are presented in a two column format with the United States FAR in the left column and the Canadian standards in the right column. Chapters, sub-chapters, sections and subsections numbering and headings are opposite to the equivalent FAR. Where the Canadian standard is identical to the FAR, the words “No Variation” appear; where a variation exists, the affected part of text is printed opposite to the FAR with all changes underlined.

AMA 533.90 entitled “Initial Maintenance Inspection” dated Jan. 1, 1987 is attached to this chapter.

**Change 533-1**

**Effective: January 1, 1987**

This change incorporates Amendment 33-11 to the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter I, Part 33 published in the Federal Register dated March 25, 1986.

- Amendment 33-11, “Turboprop Engine Propeller Brake”, establishes a new standards applicable to turbopropeller engines equipped with a propeller brake. This amendment is needed to establish an appropriate level of safety for certification of aircraft engines with this feature.

**Note:**

In 533-1 changes were identified by marginal black lines. In the future, changes will be identified by “[ ]” brackets. Editorial alterations and typographical corrections will not be identified.

**Change 533-2**

**Effective: January 1, 1989**

This change incorporates amendment 33-12 to the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter I, Part 33 published in the Federal Register on September 2, 1988. This amendment introduces the term “One-engine-inoperative (OEI)” rating, and its application, as used in “rated continuous OEI power", “rated 30-minute OEI power”, and “rated 2 1/2-minute OEI power”, together with additional requirements to be met in the endurance testing of rotorcraft engines.

**Change 533-3**

**Effective: November 1, 1991**

This change introduces an amendment to section 533.1 paragraph (b) to refer to:

- the Air Regulation enabling the type approval of aeronautical products and Chapter 511; and

- Chapter 516, Second Edition; Subchapter B.

In addition, the following amendments to the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter 1, Part 33 are included in the FAR text (left column) for completeness:

- Amendment 33-13, published in the Federal Register dated August 18, 1989, is part of a larger reorganisation of the general U.S. operating and flight rules. This amendment changes a cross reference to Part 91 in Appendix A of Part 31; therefore, it does not affect Canadian standards.

- Amendment 33-14 “Fuel Venting and Exhaust Emission Requirements for Turbine Engine Powered Aircraft”, published in the Federal Register dated August 10, 1990. This amendment introduces the requirement that new turbine engines shall comply with the requirements of the new FAR Part 34. Part 34 recodifies the aircraft engine fuel venting and exhaust emission standards of Special Federal Aviation Regulation (SFAR) 27-5. Transport Canada has adopted the fuel venting and engine emission standards of ICAO, Annex 16, Volume II entitled “Aircraft Engine Emission”, First Edition - 1981. Accordingly, section 533.1 is amended to refer to Chapter 516, Second Edition, Subchapter B.

**Change 533-4**

**Effective: December 30, 1993**

This change incorporates amendment 33-15 to the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14 Chapter I, Part 33 in the Federal Register on May 18, 1993. This amendment establishes requirements for the approval of electric and electronic engine control (EEC) systems as presented in this FAA Final Rule. Although these types of control systems have been approved under existing regulations, they do not address specific requirements related to EEC.

**Second Edition**

**Change 533-5**

**Published with Amendment 1999-4 of the CARs on  
1 December 1999**

This second edition introduces a new full page format and does not feature the left-hand column containing the FARs. Only the Canadian variations from the FARs are underlined with the FAR text following in a shaded box. The amendment number and date of affected pages has been removed from the bottom of the page. Instead, affected sections will be followed by amendment numbers and dates of current changes as well as any previous changes.

This change incorporates the following amendments to the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter 1, Part 33:

**Information Note:**

Amendment 33-16, which is for the revision of the U.S. authority citation, is not applicable in Canada and is not adopted.

**Amendment 33-17**

**Effective: April 7, 1997**

- This amendment entitled: “Continued Rotation and Rotor Locking Tests, and Vibration and Vibration Tests” published in the Federal Register dated June 4, 1996 revises the continued rotation and vibration certification standards for aircraft engines. This amendment is the result of an effort to harmonize the Federal Aviation Regulations with European Joint Airworthiness Authorities requirements. Furthermore, the increased uniformity of airworthiness requirements among the respective countries will simplify international airworthiness approval. Transport Canada shares this objective of International harmonization of airworthiness standards for the certification of aircraft engines. The adoption of this amendment has been subjected to consultation with Canadian aviation industry through NPA 96-07.

**Amendment 33-18**

**Effective: April 7, 1997**

- This amendment entitled: “Aircraft Engines New One-Engine-Inoperative (OEI) Ratings, Definitions and Type Certification Standards” published in the Federal Register dated June 19, 1996 establishes definitions and type certification of standards for new rotorcraft 30-second and 2-minute one-engine-inoperative (OEI) ratings. These new OEI ratings at higher power levels will enhance rotorcraft safety after an engine failure or precautionary shutdown. In addition, this amendment improves rotorcraft take-off and landing performances and allows for the installation of higher rated engines by rotorcraft manufacturers which will enable higher payload or shorter field take-off. The adoption of this amendment has been subjected to consultation with Canadian aviation industry through NPA 96-07.

**Amendment 33-19**

**Effective: October 29, 1998**

- This amendment entitled: “Airworthiness Standards; Rain and Hail Ingestion Standards” published in the Federal Register dated March 26, 1998 establish revisions to the Federal Aviation Administration's certification standards for rain and hail ingestion for aircraft turbine engines. These amendments address engine power-loss and instability phenomena attributed to operation in extreme rain or hail that are not adequately addressed by current requirements. These amendments also generally harmonise these standards with rain and hail ingestion standards being amended by the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA). These amendments establish nearly uniform standards for engines certified in the United States under 14 CFR Part 33 and in the JAA countries under Joint Airworthiness Requirements-Engines (JAR-E), thereby simplifying the certification of engine designs by the FAA and the JAA. Transport Canada shares this objective of International harmonisation of airworthiness standards for the certification of aircraft engines. The adoption of this amendment has been subjected to consultation with Canadian aviation industry through NPA 98-159.

**Change 533-6**

**Published: December 1, 2003**

### 1. General

This change introduces a new amendment format. This new amendment format is introduced in Chapter 533 of the Airworthiness Manual in order to be more consistent with the administrative procedures followed to amend the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs).

The following changes to the amendment procedures are introduced in this Change 533-6:

* the preamble will be the focal point regarding the sections affected by this change. The change number will no longer be provided at the end of an amended section. Rather, for the current change only, an amendment tag identifying the coming into force date of the provision will follow the amended text. (example: (amended 2003/06/01))
* brackets “[ ]” will no longer be used to identify new or revised text. In the paper version, new or revised text will be highlighted. In the electronic version, new or revised text will not be highlighted but followed by an electronic link to the previous version of the modified text. (example: (amended 2003/06/01; previous version))
* the preamble will include a table of change information. This table will include the Notices of Proposed Amendments (NPAs) with the corresponding amended sections.

### 2. FAR Amendments

This change incorporates the following amendments to the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter I, Part 33:

**FAR Amendment 33-20**

**Effective: March 5, 2001**

| Table of Change Information | |
| --- | --- |
| Notice of Proposed Amendment | Amended Section(s) |
| 2000-265 | 533.76 |
|  | 533.77 |

This amendment revises the bird ingestion type certification standards for aircraft turbine engines to better address the actual bird threat encountered in service. This amendment also establishes nearly uniform bird ingestion standards for aircraft turbine engines certified by the United States under FAA standards and by the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA) countries under JAA standards, thereby simplifying airworthiness approval for import and export.

### 3. CARAC Proposed Amendment Recommendations

There are no proposed changes to the standard recommended by the CARAC Technical Committee Part V - Certification.

**Change 533-7**

**Effective: December 1, 2004**

In an effort to harmonize our regulatory guidance documents with those of other international aviation authorities and other branches within Transport Canada Civil Aviation (TCCA), the Aircraft Certification Branch has decided to replace existing Airworthiness Manual Advisories (AMA) related to certification of aeronautical products with new Advisory Circulars (AC). While the content of the new ACs will remain technically the same as the corresponding AMAs, which they will replace, the format of the ACs will be standardized to conform to other guidance documents published within the branch.

This change in guidance documentation becomes effective 1 December 2004 at which time the AMAs will be cancelled and replaced by their corresponding Advisory Circular concurrent with the next publishing of the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CAR). After this time, the CARAC Secretariat will no longer publish these AMAs and, consequently, ACs will not be published with their corresponding AWM Chapter. As of the 1 December 2004 issue of the CARs, any affected AMA references and content will have been removed. However, the AMA Index found in AMA 500/00 will, for now, continue to exist to provide a cross-reference between the old AMAs and the new ACs.

**Change 533-8**

**Published December 30, 2006**

**Correction to English version**

**Effective: December 11, 2003**

| Table of Change Information | |
| --- | --- |
| Notice of Proposed Amendment | Amended Section(s) |
| 2003-257 | 533.7 |

This amendment entitled “Engine Ratings &Operating Limitations” corrects the English version of Section 533.7 of Chapter 533 of the Airworthiness Manual (AWM), which is currently missing subparagraph (c)(5)(v) as compared to the French version of the same section. There was no intention to create a Canadian variation as compared to the equivalent Federal Aviation Regulations Part 33, section 33.7 by omitting the missing subparagraph. Hence, the missing subparagraph is added to Chapter 533 of the AWM in order to remain harmonized with the subject section of FAR Part 33.

This change also incorporates the following amendment to the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 14, Chapter I, Part 33:

This amendment entitled “Extended Operations of Multi-Engine Airplanes” amends the airworthiness standards for aeroplane engines and contains new and revised design rules pertaining to engines intended for extended operations and installed on transport category aeroplanes.  This change harmonizes the Canadian design standards of AWM Chapter 533 for aeroplane engines seeking extended operations certification with those of FAR Part 33.

Note that this is an optional requirement for design approval for engines intended for extended operations.  Operations criteria for the acceptance of engines and aeroplanes into an extended operations role are currently contained in the operating requirements of the Safety Criteria for Approval of Extended Range Twin-Engine Operations (ETOPS) Manual, TP 6327.  Moving the design requirements into the Airworthiness Manual places them alongside other similar design standards, thereby allowing consistent management of ETOPS issues (such as establishment and maintenance of a certification basis).

Please note that a further NPA to refine terminology introduced in NPA 2012-017 has been developed.  The NPA entitled “Correction of Terms” will be published shortly under “Change 533-21 Correction.”

The purpose of this amendment is to correct the title of section 533.28 to align with the revised section title of 14 CFR 33.28 as amended by Amendment. 33-26. The revised title of section 533.28 was inadvertently not incorporated into AWM 533 as part of the amendments introduced by NPA 2009-008.

Specifically, the title of AWM 533.28 is now corrected to read “Engine Control Systems” instead of “Electrical and Electronic Engine Control Systems.”

This amendment entitled “Airworthiness Standards; Rotor Overspeed Requirements” amends the airworthiness standards for aircraft engines with respect to the aircraft turbine engine rotor overspeed type certification standards. FAA Amendment 33-31 establishes uniform rotor overspeed design and test requirements for aircraft engines and turbochargers certificated by the FAA and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA); harmonization of Canadian standards with the now common FAA – EASA standard eliminates the need to comply with differing sets of requirements for different jurisdictions.

Subsequent to publishing Amendment 33-31, the FAA published a Correction to Amendment 33-31. This correction changed some of the language within the preamble/explanation of the final rule and was intended to ensure correct understanding of and was the FAA’s response to comments received. There were no changes to the wording of the design standard; thus, the correction did not need to be adopted into the Airworthiness Manual to maintain harmonization of the design standards.

This amendment entitled ‘Technical Amendment; Airworthiness Standards—Aircraft Engines’ revises the airworthiness standards of FAR 33.87 as a result of a number of inadvertent editing errors in the airworthiness standards for aircraft engine endurance tests. None of the corrections are substantive in nature, and none will impose any additional burden on any person.

**Information Note regarding FAR Amendment 33-33:**

FAR Amendment 33-33, published in the U.S. Federal Register on July 5, 2012 (FR 39623) was intended to clarify the engine vibration test requirements and revise the regulations to clarify that engine surveys require an engine test. After further consideration, the FAA published a subsequent correction to this Amendment in the U.S. Federal Register on September 20, 2012 (FR 58301) to reverse the changes to §33.83(a) and restore its previous wording. The FAR Amendment was effectively cancelled by this correction. **Neither FAR Amendment 33-33 nor the correction to Amendment 33-33 was adopted into the Airworthiness Manual.** AWM 533.83(a), which was last revised at Change 533-5, remains harmonized with FAR 33.83(a) at Amendment 33-17, which is its current status. As the FAR amendment is not being adopted, there will be no Change 533-33 to the AWM.

### 533.17 Fire Protection

(amended 2010/05/27)

1. (a) The design and construction of the engine and the materials used must minimise the probability of the occurrence and spread of fire during normal operation and failure conditions, and must minimise the effect of such a fire. In addition, the design and construction of turbine engines must minimise the probability of the occurrence of an internal fire that could result in structural failure or other hazardous conditions.  
   (amended 2010/05/27)
2. (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, each external line, fitting and other component, which contains or conveys flammable fluid during normal engine operation, must be fire resistant or fireproof, as determined by the Minister. Components must be shielded or located to safeguard against the ignition of leaking flammable fluid.  
   (amended 2010/05/27)
3. (c) A tank, which contains flammable fluid and any associated shut-off means and supports, which are part of and attached to the engine must be fireproof either by construction or by protection unless damage by fire will not cause leakage or spillage of a hazardous quantity of flammable fluid. For a reciprocating engine having an integral oil sump of less than 23.7 litres (25-quart) capacity, the oil sump need not be fireproof or enclosed by a fireproof shield.  
   (amended 2010/05/27)

6. (f) Unintentional accumulation of hazardous quantities of flammable fluid within the engine must be prevented by draining and venting.  
   (amended 2010/05/27)
7. (g) Any components, modules, or equipment, which are susceptible to, or are potential sources of static discharges or electrical fault currents must be designed and constructed to be properly grounded to the engine reference, to minimise the risk of ignition in external areas where flammable fluids or vapours could be present.  
   (amended 2010/05/27; no previous version)

### 533.19 Durability

1. (a) Engine design and construction must minimise the development of an unsafe condition of the engine between overhaul periods. The design of the compressor and turbine rotor cases must provide for the containment of damage from rotor blade failure. Energy levels and trajectories of fragments resulting from rotor blade failure that lie outside the compressor and turbine rotor cases must be defined.
2. (b) Each component of the propeller blade pitch control system which is a part of the engine type design must meet the requirements of sections [535.21](/en/corporate-services/acts-regulations/list-regulations/canadian-aviation-regulations-sor-96-433/standards/part-v-airworthiness-manual-chapter-535-propellers#535_21 "Part V - Airworthiness Manual Chapter 535 - Propellers"), [535.23](/en/corporate-services/acts-regulations/list-regulations/canadian-aviation-regulations-sor-96-433/standards/part-v-airworthiness-manual-chapter-535-propellers#535_23 "Part V - Airworthiness Manual Chapter 535 - Propellers"), [535.42](/en/corporate-services/acts-regulations/list-regulations/canadian-aviation-regulations-sor-96-433/standards/part-v-airworthiness-manual-chapter-535-propellers#535_42 "Part V - Airworthiness Manual Chapter 535 - Propellers") and [535.43](/en/corporate-services/acts-regulations/list-regulations/canadian-aviation-regulations-sor-96-433/standards/part-v-airworthiness-manual-chapter-535-propellers#535_43 "Part V - Airworthiness Manual Chapter 535 - Propellers") of this Manual.  
   (amended 2010/01/29)

### 533.21 Engine Cooling

Engine design and construction must provide the necessary cooling under conditions in which the aeroplane is expected to operate.

### 533.23 Engine Mounting Attachments and Structure

1. (a) The maximum allowable limit and ultimate loads for engine mounting attachments and related structure must be specified.
2. (b) The engine mounting attachments and related engine structure must be able to withstand:
   1. (1) The specified limit loads without permanent deformation; and
   2. (2) The specified ultimate loads without failure, but may exhibit permanent deformation.

### 533.25 Accessory Attachments

The engine must operate properly with the accessory drive and mounting attachments loaded. Each engine accessory drive and mounting attachment must include provisions for sealing to prevent contamination of, or unacceptable leakage from, the engine interior. A drive and mounting attachment requiring lubrication for external drive splines, or coupling by engine oil, must include provisions for sealing to prevent unacceptable loss of oil and to prevent contamination from sources outside the chamber enclosing the drive connection. The design of the engine must allow for the examination, adjustment, or removal of each accessory required for engine operation.

### 533.27 Turbine, Compressor, Fan and Turbosupercharger Rotors Overspeed

(effective 2012/12/18)

1. (a) For each turbine, fan, compressor, and turbosupercharger rotor, the applicant must establish by test, analysis, or a combination of both, that each rotor will not burst when operated in the engine for 5 minutes at whichever of the conditions defined in paragraph (b) of this section is the most critical with respect to the integrity of such a rotor.
   1. (1) Test rotors used to demonstrate compliance with this section that do not have the most adverse combination of material properties and dimensional tolerances must be tested at conditions which have been adjusted to ensure the minimum specification rotor possesses the required overspeed capability. This can be accomplished by increasing test speed, temperature, and/or loads.
   2. (2) When an engine test is being used to demonstrate compliance with the overspeed conditions listed in paragraph (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section and the failure of a component or system is sudden and transient, it may not be possible to operate the engine for 5 minutes after the failure. Under these circumstances, the actual overspeed duration is acceptable if the required maximum overspeed is achieved.
2. (b) When determining the maximum overspeed condition applicable to each rotor in order to comply with paragraphs (a) and (c) of this section, the applicant must evaluate the following rotor speeds taking into consideration the part’s operating temperatures and temperature gradients throughout the engine’s operating envelope:
   1. (1) 120 percent of the maximum permissible rotor speed associated with any of the engine ratings except one engine- inoperative (OEI) ratings of less than 2½ minutes;
   2. (2) 115 percent of the maximum permissible rotor speed associated with any OEI ratings of less than 2½ minutes;
   3. (3) 105 percent of the highest rotor speed that would result from either:
      1. (i) the failure of the component or system which, in a representative installation of the engine, is the most critical with respect to overspeed when operating at any rating condition except OEI ratings of less than 2½ minutes, or
      2. (ii) the failure of any component or system which in a representative installation of the engine, in combination with any other failure of a component or system that would not normally be detected during a routine pre-flight check or during normal flight operation, that is the most critical with respect to overspeed, except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section, when operating at any rating condition except OEI ratings of less than 2½ minutes; and
   4. (4) 100 percent of the highest rotor speed that would result from the failure of the component or system which, in a representative installation of the engine, is the most critical with respect to overspeed when operating at any OEI rating of less than 2½ minutes.
3. (c) The highest overspeed that results from a complete loss of load on a turbine rotor, except as provided by paragraph (f) of this section, must be included in the overspeed conditions considered by paragraphs (b)(3)(i), (b)(3)(ii), and (b)(4) of this section, regardless of whether that overspeed results from a failure within the engine or external to the engine. The overspeed resulting from any other single failure must be considered when selecting the most limiting overspeed conditions applicable to each rotor. Overspeeds resulting from combinations of failures must also be considered unless the applicant can show that the probability of occurrence is not greater than extremely remote (probability range of 10-7 to 10-9 per engine flight hour).
4. (d) In addition, the applicant must demonstrate that each fan, compressor, turbine, and turbosupercharger rotor complies with paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section for the maximum overspeed achieved when subjected to the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section. The applicant must use the approach in paragraph (a) of this section which specifies the required test conditions.
   1. (1) Rotor growth must not cause the engine to:
      1. (i) catch fire,
      2. (ii) release high-energy debris through the engine casing or result in a hazardous failure of the engine casing,
      3. (iii) generate loads greater than those ultimate loads specified in 533.23(a), or
      4. (iv) lose the capability of being shut down.
   2. (2) Following an overspeed event and after continued operation, the rotor may not exhibit conditions such as cracking or distortion which preclude continued safe operation.
5. (e) The design and functioning of engine control systems, instruments, and other methods not covered under 533.28 must ensure that the engine operating limitations that affect turbine, compressor, fan and turbosupercharger rotor structural integrity will not be exceeded in service.
6. (f) Failure of a shaft section may be excluded from consideration in determining the highest overspeed that would result from a complete loss of load on a turbine rotor if the applicant:
   1. (1) identifies the shaft as an engine life-limited-part and complies with 533.70;
   2. (2) uses material and design features that are well understood and that can be analyzed by well-established and validated stress analysis techniques;
   3. (3) determines, based on an assessment of the environment surrounding the shaft section, that environmental influences are unlikely to cause a shaft failure. This assessment must include complexity of design, corrosion, wear, vibration, fire, contact with adjacent components or structure, overheating and secondary effects from other failures or combination of failures;
   4. (4) identifies and declares, in accordance with 533.5, any assumptions regarding the engine installation in making the assessment described in paragraph (f)(3) of this section;
   5. (5) assesses and considers as appropriate, experience with shaft sections of similar design;
   6. (6) does not exclude the entire shaft.
7. (g) If analysis is used to meet the overspeed requirements, then the analytical tool must be validated to prior overspeed test results of a similar rotor. The tool must be validated for each material. The rotor being certified must not exceed the boundaries of the rotors being used to validate the analytical tool in terms of geometric shape, operating stress, and temperature. Validation includes the ability to accurately predict rotor dimensional growth and the burst speed. The predictions must also show that the rotor being certified does not have lower burst and growth margins than rotors used to validate the tool.

Power ratings are based upon standard atmospheric conditions with only those accessories installed which are essential for engine functioning.
2. (b) A power check at sea level conditions must be accomplished on the endurance test engine after the endurance test. Any change in power characteristics which occurs during the endurance test must be determined. Measurements taken during the final portion of the endurance test may be used in showing compliance with the requirements of this paragraph.

The 5-second power or thrust response must occur from a stabilised static condition using only the bleed air and accessories loads necessary to run the engine. This take-off rating is specified by the applicant and need not include thrust augmentation.

### 533.74 Continued Rotation

If any of the engine main rotating systems continue to rotate after the engine is shutdown for any reason while in flight, and if means to prevent that continued rotation are not provided, then any continued rotation during the maximum period of flight, and in the flight conditions expected to occur with that engine inoperative, shall not result in any condition described in 533.75 (g)(2)(i) through (vi) of this chapter.

### 533.75 Safety Analysis

1. (a)  
   (amended 2008/10/30)
   1. (1) The applicant shall analyze the engine, including the control system, to assess the likely consequences of all failures that can reasonably be expected to occur. This analysis will take into account, if applicable:  
      (amended 2008/10/30; no previous version)
      1. (i) Aircraft-level devices and procedures assumed to be associated with a typical installation. Such assumptions shall be stated in the analysis.  
         (amended 2008/10/30; no previous version)
      2. (ii) Consequential secondary failures and latent failures.  
         (amended 2008/10/30; no previous version)
      3. (iii) Multiple failures referred to in paragraph (d) of this section or that result in the hazardous engine effects defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.  
         (amended 2008/10/30; no previous version)
   2. (2) The applicant shall summarize those failures that could result in major engine effects or hazardous engine effects, as defined in paragraph (g) of this section, and estimate the probability of occurrence of those effects. Any engine part the failure of which could reasonably result in a hazardous engine effect shall be clearly identified in this summary.  
      (amended 2008/10/30; no previous version)
   3. (3) The applicant shall show that hazardous engine effects are predicted to occur at a rate not in excess of that defined as extremely remote (probability range of 10-7 to 10-9 per engine flight hour). Since the estimated probability for individual failures may be insufficiently precise to enable the applicant to assess the total rate for hazardous engine effects, compliance may be shown by demonstrating that the probability of a hazardous engine effect arising from an individual failure can be predicted to be no greater than 10-8 per engine flight hour. In dealing with probabilities of this low order of magnitude, absolute proof is not possible, and compliance may be shown by reliance on engineering judgment and previous experience combined with sound design and test philosophies.  
      (amended 2008/10/30; no previous version)
   4. (4) The applicant shall show that major engine effects are predicted to occur at a rate not in excess of that defined as remote (probability range of 10-5 to 10-7 per engine flight hour).  
      (amended 2008/10/30; no previous version)
2. (b) The Minister may require that any assumption as to the effects of failures and likely combination of failures be verified by test.  
   (amended 2008/10/30)
3. (c) The primary failure of certain single elements cannot be sensibly estimated in numerical terms. If the failure of such elements is likely to result in hazardous engine effects, then compliance may be shown by reliance on the prescribed integrity requirements of 533.15, 533.27, and 533.70 as applicable. These instances shall be stated in the safety analysis.  
   (amended 2008/10/30)
4. (d) If reliance is placed on a safety system to prevent a failure from progressing to hazardous engine effects, the possibility of a safety system failure in combination with a basic engine failure shall be included in the analysis. Such a safety system may include safety devices, instrumentation, early warning devices, maintenance checks, and other similar equipment or procedures. If items of a safety system are outside the control of the engine manufacturer, the assumptions of the safety analysis with respect to the reliability of these parts shall be clearly stated in the analysis and identified in the installation instructions under 533.5 of this chapter.  
   (amended 2008/10/30)
5. (e) If the safety analysis depends on one or more of the following items, those items shall be identified in the analysis and appropriately substantiated.  
   (amended 2008/10/30; no previous version)
   1. (1) Maintenance actions being carried out at stated intervals. This includes the verification of the serviceability of items that could fail in a latent manner.

### 533.78 Rain and Hail Ingestion

1. (a) All engines.
   1. (1) The ingestion of large hailstones (0.8 to 0.9 specific gravity) at the maximum true air speed, up to 15,000 feet (4,500 meters), associated with a representative aircraft operating in rough air, with the engine at maximum continuous power, may not cause unacceptable mechanical damage or unacceptable power or thrust loss after the ingestion, or require the engine to be shut down. One-half the number of hailstones shall be aimed randomly over the inlet face area and the other half aimed at the critical inlet face area. The hailstones shall be ingested in a rapid sequence to simulate a hailstone encounter and the number and size of the hailstones shall be determined as follows:
      1. (i) One 1-inch (25 millimeters) diameter hailstone for engines with inlet areas of not more than 100 square inches (0.0645 square meters). [(ii) One 1-inch (25 millimeters) diameter and one 2-inch (50 millimeters) diameter hailstone for each 150 square inches (0.0968 square meters) of inlet area, or fraction thereof, for engines with inlet areas of more than 100 square inches (0.0645 square meters).
   2. (2) In addition to complying with paragraph (a)(1) of this section and except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, it must be shown that each engine is capable of acceptable operation throughout its specified operating envelope when subjected to sudden encounters with the certification standard concentrations of rain and hail, as defined in [appendix B](#app-b) to this part. Acceptable engine operation precludes flameout, run down, continued or non-recoverable surge or stall, or loss of acceleration and deceleration capability, during any three minute continuous period in rain and during any 30 second continuous period in hail. It must also be shown after the ingestion that there is no unacceptable mechanical damage, unacceptable power or thrust loss, or other adverse engine anomalies.
2. (b) Engines for rotorcraft. As an alternative to the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, for rotorcraft turbine engines only, it must be shown that each engine is capable of acceptable operation during and after the ingestion of rain with an overall ratio of water droplet flow to airflow, by weight, with a uniform distribution at the inlet plane, of at least four percent. Acceptable engine operation precludes flameout, run down, continued or non-recoverable surge or stall, or loss of acceleration and deceleration capability. It must also be shown after the ingestion that there is no unacceptable mechanical damage, unacceptable power loss, or other adverse engine anomalies. The rain ingestion must occur under the following static ground level conditions:
   1. (1) A normal stabilization period at take-off power without rain ingestion, followed immediately by the suddenly commencing ingestion of rain for three minutes at take-off power, then
   2. (2) Continuation of the rain ingestion during subsequent rapid deceleration to minimum idle, then

3. (c) Engines for supersonic aeroplanes. In addition to complying with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, a separate test for supersonic aeroplane engines only, shall be conducted with three hailstones ingested at supersonic cruise velocity. These hailstones shall be aimed at the engine's critical face area, and their ingestion must not cause unacceptable mechanical damage or unacceptable power or thrust loss after the ingestion or require the engine to be shut down. The size of these hailstones shall be determined from the linear variation in diameter from 1-inch (25 millimeters) at 35,000 feet (10,500 meters) to 1/4 - inch (6 millimeters) at 60,000 feet (18,000 meters) using the diameter corresponding to the lowest expected supersonic cruise altitude. Alternatively, three larger hailstones may be ingested at subsonic velocities such that the kinetic energy of these larger hailstones is equivalent to the applicable supersonic ingestion conditions.
4. (d) For an engine that incorporates or requires the use of a protection device, demonstration of the rain and hail ingestion capabilities of the engine, as required in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, may be waived wholly or in part by the Minister if the applicant shows that:
   1. (1) The subject rain and hail constituents are of a size that will not pass through the protection device;
   2. (2) The protection device will withstand the impact of the subject rain and hail constituents; and
   3. (3) The subject of rain and hail constituents, stopped by the protection device, will not obstruct the flow of induction air into the engine, resulting in damage, power or thrust loss, or other adverse engine anomalies in excess of what would be accepted in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.]

If there is any indication of a stress peak arising at the highest of those required physical or corrected rotational speeds, the surveys shall be extended sufficiently to reveal the maximum stress values present, except that the extension need not cover more than a further 2 percentage points increase beyond those speeds.
3. (c) Evaluations shall be made of the following:
   1. (1) The effects on vibration characteristics of operating with scheduled changes (including tolerances) to variable vane angles, compressor bleeds, accessory loading, the most adverse inlet air flow distortion pattern declared by the manufacturer, and the most adverse conditions in the exhaust duct(s); and
   2. (2) The aerodynamic and aeromechanical factors which might induce or influence flutter in those systems susceptible to that form of vibration.
4. (d) Except as provided by paragraph (e) of this section, the vibration stresses associated with the vibration characteristics determined under this section, when combined with the appropriate steady stresses, must be less than the endurance limits of the materials concerned, after making due allowances for operating conditions for the permitted variations in properties of the materials. The suitability of these stress margins must be justified for each part evaluated. If it is determined that certain operating conditions, or ranges, need to be limited, operating and installation limitations shall be established.
5. (e) The effects on vibration characteristics of excitation forces caused by fault conditions (such as, but not limited to, out-of balance, local blockage or enlargement of stator vane passages, fuel nozzle blockage, incorrectly schedule compressor variables, etc.) shall be evaluated by test or analysis, or by reference to previous experience and shall be shown not to create a hazardous condition.
6. (f) Compliance with this section shall be substantiated for each specific installation configuration that can affect the vibration characteristics of the engine. If these vibration effects cannot be fully investigated during engine certification, the methods by which they can be evaluated and methods by which compliance can be shown shall be substantiated and defined in the installation instructions required by [533.5](#533s_5).

An applicant without adequate service data must show experience with and knowledge of problem mitigating design practices equivalent to that gained from actual service experience in a manner acceptable to the Minister.
3. (c) Except as specified in paragraph (f) of this section, the applicant must conduct a simulated ETOPS mission cyclic endurance test in accordance with an approved test plan on an engine that substantially conforms to the type design. The test must:
   1.

   2. (2) be performed with the high speed and low speed main engine rotors independently unbalanced to obtain a minimum of 90 percent of the recommended field service maintenance vibration levels. For engines with three main engine rotors, the intermediate speed rotor must be independently unbalanced to obtain a minimum of 90 percent of the recommended production acceptance vibration level. The required peak vibration levels must be verified during a slow acceleration and deceleration run of the test engine covering the main engine rotor operating speed ranges;
   3. (3) include a minimum of 3,000,000 vibration cycles for each 60 rpm incremental step of the typical high-speed rotor start-stop mission cycle. The test may be conducted using any rotor speed step increment from 60 to 200 rpm provided the test encompasses the typical service start-stop cycle speed range. For incremental steps greater than 60 rpm, the minimum number of vibration cycles must be linearly increased up to 10,000,000 cycles for a 200 rpm incremental step;
   4. (4) include a minimum of 300,000 vibration cycles for each 60 rpm incremental step of the high-speed rotor approved operational speed range between minimum flight idle and cruise power not covered by paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The test may be conducted using any rotor speed step increment from 60 to 200 rpm provided the test encompasses the applicable speed range. For incremental steps greater than 60 rpm the minimum number of vibration cycles must be linearly increased up to 1,000,000 for a 200 rpm incremental step;

      3. (iii) in a manner to identify wear or distress conditions that could result in an IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss not specifically identified by paragraph (b) of this section or addressed within the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness; and
   4. (4) not show wear or distress to the extent that could result in an IFSD, loss of thrust control, or other power loss within a period of operation before the component, assembly, or system would likely have been inspected or functionally tested for integrity while in service. Such wear or distress must have corrective action implemented through a design change, a change to maintenance instructions, or operational procedures before ETOPS eligibility is granted. The type and frequency of wear and distress that occurs during the engine test must be consistent with the type and frequency of wear and distress that would be expected to occur on ETOPS eligible engines.
6. (f) An alternative mission cycle endurance test that provides an equivalent demonstration of the unbalance and vibration specified in paragraph (c) of this section may be used when approved by the Minister.
7. (g) For an applicant using the simulated ETOPS mission cyclic endurance test to comply with 533.90(a), the test may be interrupted so that the engine may be inspected in accordance with the recommendations and limits contained in the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness submitted in compliance with 533.4 or other method, using criteria acceptable to the Minister, after completion of the test cycles required to comply with 533.90(a). Following the inspection, the ETOPS test must be resumed to complete the requirements of this section.

## Appendix B - Certification Standard Atmospheric Concentrations of Rain and Hail

**Content last revised: 1999/12/01**

Figure B1, Table B1, Table B2, Table B3, and Table B4 specify the atmospheric concentrations and size distributions of rain and hail for establishing certification, in accordance with the requirements of [Sec.533.78(a)(2)](#533s_78_a_2). In conducting tests, normally by spraying liquid water to simulate rain conditions and by delivering hail fabricated from ice to simulate hail conditions, the use of water droplets and hail having shapes, sizes and distributions of sizes other than those defined in this appendix B, or the use of a single size or shape for each water droplet or hail, can be accepted, provided that applicant shows that the substitution does not reduce the severity of the test.

## Appendix D - Mixed Phase and Ice Crystal Icing Envelope (Deep Convective Clouds)

(effective 04/08/2021)

The ice crystal icing envelope is depicted in Figure D1 of this Appendix.  
(effective 2021/04/08)

**Figure D1 – Convective Cloud Ice Crystal Envelope**

![appendix_d_image1](/sites/default/files/2021-07/appendix_d_image1.JPG "appendix_d_image1")

Figure D1 – Convective Cloud Ice Crystal Envelope

The diagram determines the altitude and ambient temperature range within the ice crystal icing (deep convective clouds) envelope. The horizontal axis represents altitude from 0 to 50,000 feet. The vertical axis represents ambient temperature from 0 degrees Celsius to -70 degrees Celsius. The ice crystal icing envelope starts at around -3.5 degrees Celsius on a horizontal line from approximately 4,048 feet to 20, 000 feet altitude. At 20, 000 feet, a line is drawn on a negative slope till it reaches -60 degrees Celsius and around 47,381 feet. At this point, the line becomes horizontal and extends to the left till 39, 524 feet altitude. At 39,524 feet, a line is drawn on a slope till the -40 degrees Celsius and 30,000 feet point. The line is then extended to the left on the horizontal -40 degrees line to approximately 18,810 feet altitude. From this point, a line is drawn till the -10 degrees Celsius and 4,048 feet altitude point. Finally, a vertical line is drawn to -3.5 degrees Celsius and 4,048 feet altitude. The white area enclosed by the joined lines is the envelope.

Within the envelope, total water content (TWC) in g/m3 has been determined based upon the adiabatic lapse defined by the convective rise of 90% relative humidity air from sea level to higher altitudes and scaled by a factor of 0.65 to a standard cloud length of 17.4 nautical miles. Figure D2 of this Appendix displays TWC for this distance over a range of ambient temperature within the boundaries of the ice crystal envelope specified in Figure D1 of this Appendix.

Figure D2 – Total Water Content

Within the ice crystal icing envelope in Figure D1, the total water content (TWC) in g/m3 has been determined based upon the adiabatic lapse defined by the convective rise of 90% relative humidity air from sea level to higher altitudes and scaled by a factor of 0.65 to a standard cloud length of 17.4 nautical miles. Figure D2 displays TWC for this distance over a range of ambient temperature within the boundaries of the ice crystal envelope specified in Figure D1. The horizontal axis represents altitude from 0 to 50,000 feet. The vertical axis represents TWC from 0 to 6 g/m3. Curves are drawn from approximately 4,048 feet to 47,381 feet altitudes. Several curves are plotted as a function of ambient temperatures ranging from 0 degrees Celsius to -60 degrees Celsius.

Ice crystal size median mass dimension (MMD) range is 50–200 microns (equivalent spherical size) based upon measurements near convective storm cores.

The TWC can be treated as completely glaciated (ice crystal) except as noted in the Table 1 of this Appendix.

Figure D3 – Exposure Length Influence on TWC

The TWC levels displayed in Figure D2 represent TWC values for a standard exposure distance (horizontal cloud length) of 17.4 nautical miles that must be adjusted with length of icing exposure. Figure D3 displays the TWC factor for the horizontal extent. The diagram is displayed on a logarithmic scale starting on the horizontal axis representing cloud horizontal extent from 1 to 1000 nautical miles. The vertical axis represents total water content (TWC) scale factor from 0.6 to 1.2. At approximately 4.5 nautical miles and slightly above 1.12, a line is drawn along a negative slope till the point defined by the 200 nautical mile and 0.74 TWC scale factor.
